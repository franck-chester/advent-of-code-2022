# advent-of-code-2022
My 2022 attempt at the https://adventofcode.com/ challenge.

Competing against my colleagues at the very group, although this year I doubt I'll have sufficient time or head space to have a proper go.


## Day 1: 

Easy enough but it's been so long since I last coded I couldn't even remember how to find the max value in my array.

Things I'd like to do:
- switch to typescript
- write code that wouldn't get me kicked out 
of a leetcode test
- add a github action to this repo to let me do the 
AoC from my phone

## Day 2: 

Lazy but yet clever approach I'd say - encode the rules rather than calculate them

## Day 3:

It's official, I can't remember how to code anymore. 
Struggled with a variable / function name clash, then whether to use `i+=3` or `i=+3` to step through the list

Code left raw, to show how bad things are right now
